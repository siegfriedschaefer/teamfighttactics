Can I learn to play TFT with the help of Claude Sonnet 3.5?

This is a holidays project, so I do not know how much efforts I will spend on it.

I don't lik the game, yet, because i have never played something like that, but my sons do, so ...

Way too much to learn, to fast to get everything done and no time / mood to learn it.

SO, asking Claude some questions, have a look at the journal!

Stay tuned.
